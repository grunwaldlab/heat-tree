# Architecture

## Design philosophy

* Minimal dependencies
* Light weight, fast, and scalable
* Self contained widget easily embedded in offline documents

## Tools used

- D3
- `vite`: packaging distributions
- `vitest`: unit testing
- `http-server`: serving test pages using the widget in `./demo`
