When the aesthetic for the tip labels are undefined by the user (null), or a aesthetic is defined but there is no data for that node, then make the "tip" labels for nodes with children "Clade with # tips", where # is the number of tips in that node. If an aesthetic is defined, and there is a tip label for that internal node, use that instead.
