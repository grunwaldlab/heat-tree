Allow heatTree to take multiple newick files assocaited with multiple sets of metadata tables. Instead of a newick string as the first imput, accept an object with an array or list of objects, each with a tree and one or more assocaited metadata tables. TreeState and treeView instances should be made for each tree as needed (when they are selected for viewing with the "select tree" control). Instances that are not currently being viewed should be preserved, but their assocaited DOM can be discarded. 
There should be one treeData instance per tree.
TreeState treeData and treeView instances should be cached and resused.
All of the settings assocaited with control configuation should be inferred from TreeState. TreeState is the only thing modfied by controls.
The first tree in the array should be displayed initially.
The function should require this new input format.
