Add boxes to detect the clicks that will expand collapsed subtrees instead of checking for clicks on the triangle/label. These can be added to the `hit-layer`. The boxes should be adjacent to the tips and rotated in circular layouts the same way that node labels are. They should be long enough to fit the triaangle and the label. These hit boxes should have precendence over the hit boxes used to select nodes.
