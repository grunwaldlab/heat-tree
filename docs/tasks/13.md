Create a subtree selection button that switches child taxon display order. Every time it is clicked it should shift the order one over. Implement this by adding functions to `treeData` to modify the unerlying tree state and functions to `treeView` that call those functions. Create a button that looks like a two pronged fork facing right next to a curve like a closing parthentheses with arrows on both sides. Make this button visible with non-tips are selected.
