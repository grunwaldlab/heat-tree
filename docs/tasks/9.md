Add `columnColorScale` and `columnSizeScale` Maps to `TreeData` that store scale instances from the classes in `src/scales.js` for each column.
Make these private, and make getter and setters that take the name of the column to get/set scales for.
The scales should only be created when needed, so the getter should check if one alrteady exists for a given column and create it if needed before returning it.
Which kind of scale used should be inferred from the `columnType`.
When data is removed with `deleteTable`, the associated scales should also be removed.
