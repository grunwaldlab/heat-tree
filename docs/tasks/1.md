modify the continuous color legend so that labels for particular values are printed below the color bar centered on a tick mark where the label corresponds to. Make the bar takes up however much vertical space is left over after labels and ticks are accounted for. Choose nice looking round numbers (can be decmals but limit significant fugures) for the tick mark locations and labels.
