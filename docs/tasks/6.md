Display a copy of the scale bar svg in the tree plotting space below the tree and to the left so it is included in exported SVGs.
It should not move relative to the tree and not change depending on zoom like the legend div scale bar.
It should be updated when the tree is redrawn.
When the scale bar in the tree's SVG is visible in the current view, dont show the copy of the scale bar in the bottom legend div.
