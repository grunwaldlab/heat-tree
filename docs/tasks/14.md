Allow the widget to select which metadata column in each table contains the node IDs instead of assuming it is always "node_id".
Add a drop down titled "Node/Tip ID Column" to select this column name in the "Data" tab.
Only consider or allow the user to select columns that have at least one valid node id in them.
When a new column is selected by the dropdown, reparse the tree metadata, since it will have all changed.

Steps

1. Modify treeData and parsers. `parseTable` will need to be modified to not require or use a ID column. treeData will need to test and keep track of which columns contain valid node IDs and default to picking the one with the most node valid node IDs for the given tree. When data is first parsed, the output of `parseTable` will need to be modified by `treeData` to name it by the selected node ID column. `treedata` will need functions to change the node ID column, which will require modifing the tables and reattaching them to the tree.
2. Implement the controls that allow users to select columns with valid IDs and call the treeData functions to make that happen. If there are no columns with valid IDs, the dropdown is greyed out and displays "No ID column found". The dropdown should display data for the currently selected metadata table in the "Available metadata" dropdown
